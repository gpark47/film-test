Housemaid ","Kim, Ki-young",1960,"This film follows a male protagonist who works as a music teacher
at a textile factory. One of the girls at the textile factory is hired to work
for his family as a housemaid. Following the Korean war, poor rural families sent
women to newly established factories in the city in order to earn income. The
hiring of rural women as housemaids (see
The Handmaiden) and ‘factory girls’ were not new however; the latter arose
amidst industrialization in the 1920s. Notably, the director also explores the
experience of ‘Western’ imports such as fashion and norms. In summary, this
film explores class dynamics and ‘factory girls’ in post-war Korea. ",,,,,,,Text,,English; Korean; French; Japanese,,,record,,,
